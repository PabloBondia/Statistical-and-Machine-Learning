## >Q Conceptual exercise 

It was stated in the textbook - `it is not hard to show ` that classifying an observation to the class for which (4.17) is largest is equivalent to classifying an observation to the class for which (4.18) is largest. 

I hate it when math people do that ... but let's try to do just that because there is actually a few intuitions to be gained once we digest the notations and what they actually mean.

We will do that by looking closely at the ingredients $f_k(x)$ and $\pi_k$ in the simplest case where we do LDA with $p=1$ predictor. 

The goal is to show with pencil and paper that maximizing the discriminant function $\delta_k(x)$ amounts to maximizing the posterior probability $p_k(x)$

Our assumptions are that the observations in the kth
class are drawn from a $N(Î¼_k,\sigma^2)$ distribution, the Bayes classifier assigns an observation to the class for which the discriminant function is maximized


**Hint**: read back the section 
`4.4.1 Linear Discriminant Analysis for p = 1` and recognize that although this expression below looks: 

![](sca_eq4.17.png)

But a few tricks can come handy .. 

A first trick is that there are a lot of ugly terms that are actually constants there. In particular remember that the bulky denominator that looks very intimidating is really $p(x)$ so it is actually a constant that carries no information of which $p_k(x)$ is bigger.

The second trick is to take `log()` because we can get rid of $exp(...)$ and taking log() of two expression is legit because you still get the max at the same location (we do that all the time when doing likelihood functions).

The last trick is to develop the $(x - \mu_k)^2$ term as and to recognize again what are terms that depend on $x$ only .. because these can also be seen as constant once you get a given x value there is no information on how to classify 


## >Q Implement  & compare 2 other methods (QDA/LDA/Naive Bayes) with your previous favorite. classifier

Compare the performance of LDA QDA and the method we have used for your first round of prediction  (i.e. logistic regression or KNN).
Compare their ability to classify `Normal/Cancer` by feeding them the same set of predictors as the one you used for your first submission round. 
Note you could  use any predictors from the TCGA dataset (i.e. individual gene expression predictors and or PC1 to PC3).


## >Q use cross validation to examine how accurate are the predictions you can make with LDA and QDA


## >Q Get ready submit your second  best predictions as a TEAM using a rds format 
Now you are ahead of the next assignment :0).
